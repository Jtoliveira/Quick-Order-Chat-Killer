# Quick-Order-Chat-Killer

This is a very simple bot written in Python that spams any window on your computer with a custom message (works best on messaging apps).

The file you want is spam_exe.exe and it works in three steps:

1. Input in the first field the text you want to spam (no character limit, i think)

2. Choose the number of times you want it to be spammed (AKA the number of messages you want to send)

3. Click the Button
